/**
 * EnerJeep Cloud Functions.
 *
 * The Android app can delete the Firestore documents of an account
 * (/users/{phone} and /userSecrets/{phone}), but the Firebase
 * Authentication record CANNOT be deleted from the client (Firebase
 * does not allow one user to delete another Auth user). Without this
 * function the Auth record would survive the deletion and the phone
 * number could never be used again for a new account.
 *
 * This function listens for the account document deletion and removes
 * the matching Firebase Auth user (found by its phone number, which is
 * also the document id).
 *
 * Deploy (requires the Blaze/pay-as-you-go plan):
 *
 *   cd functions && npm install && cd ..
 *   firebase deploy --only functions
